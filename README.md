# React-fibonacci
## About
This is a simple app for generating fibonacci sequences using basic React.

It takes integers from 1 to 1476 as an input and displays the calculated fibonacci value F(n).

The Fibonacci sequence **F(n)** can be defined by:

F(1) = 1

F(2) = 1

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n >= 2
